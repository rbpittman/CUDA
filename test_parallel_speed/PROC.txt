Write a kernel that does a specific large computation. 
This will compute the 100th or so prime number. This operation should 
take like 5sec/(512*4). 
Increase the number of threads and time how long it takes to complete. 

Theoretically, it should increase only when the number of threads 
exceeds 768. 
Go up to 1024 threads, stepping such that all steps are divisible by 
32, and the number of blocks does not exceed 8.
